# **Course Registration System**

## **Overview**
This repository contains the implementation of a **Course Registration System** project developed using **Microsoft Access**. The project models the process of course registration at a college, ensuring efficient management of students, advisors, instructors, courses, classrooms, and evaluations.

The repository includes:

- A `tables` folder with the exported database tables.
- A **Relationships Diagram** (`Relationships.pdf`) showing table relationships.
- A **Final Project** document (`Finalproject.pdf`) with the problem statement, assumptions, relationship sentences, logical modeling, and normalization steps.

## **Repository Contents**

### **1. `tables`**
This folder contains exported tables from the Access database in `.csv` format:
- `advisors.txt`
- `students.txt`
- `courses.txt`
- `sections.txt`
- `classrooms.txt`
- `evaluations.txt`

### **2. `Relationships.pdf`**
A PDF file illustrating the relationships between the tables, including primary and foreign keys. This diagram was created in Microsoft Accessâ€™s Relationship View.

### **3. `Finalproject.pdf`**
This document provides detailed documentation of the project:
- Problem Statement
- Assumptions
- Relationship Sentences
- Logical Modeling
- Normalization Process

   ```
2. Open the database relationships and exported tables:
   - Use **Microsoft Access** to review the database relationships.
   - Open the `.tx6` files in the `tables` folder for raw table data.
3. Refer to the `Finalproject.pdf` document for a detailed understanding of the project design.
